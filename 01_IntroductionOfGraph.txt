1   - if graph has arrows we can say this is directed graph 
2   - if graph has no arrows we can say this is undirected graph (bidirectional edge present)
3   - start from a node and end at same node -> then there cycle is present 
4   - cyclic graph can be directed or undirected as well 
5   - node can't apper on a path 
6   - No of incoming edge is called degree of a graph 
7   - total degree of a graph is total number of edge * 2 
8   - there are two types of degree { indegree and outdegree} 
9   - indegree means incoming edges and outdegree means outgoing edges 
10  - if weight is assign with edge is called edge weight and if weight not assign we can say this is unit weights
